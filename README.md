# Lox

This is my interpretation of the **Lox** scripting language, following
the excellent book: [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

## Language Choice

I went with doing everything in C++, unlike Java and C, as done in the book. I like
using a unified language for everything, and I wanted to improve my understanding of using
C++ for "real things".
